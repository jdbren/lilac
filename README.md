Lilac is a hobby operating system project running on x86 (32-bit) in 
early development. I have created it for fun as a way to learn about kernel 
programming and operating system fundamentals. 

The entry point is _start in the x86 boot folder. I am testing on the Qemu q35 
emulator (for x86_64) with OVFM firmware from the EDK2 project, and I am using 
a Grub2 EFI application as the bootloader. I intend to add better documentation soon.
