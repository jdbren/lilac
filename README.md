Lilac is a hobby operating system project running on x86 (32-bit) in 
very early stages of development. I am currently working on implementing
processes and the ability to run user mode applications.

I have created it for fun as a way to learn about kernel programming
and operating system fundamentals.

For more information about OS development see https://osdev.org.
I have used that as a reference and adapted several assembly routines
from various pages, as well as the general template for building.
